## 1. Main Concepts Applied;
In creating this personal portfolio website, several key web development concepts were applied. Some of them are:
HTML Structure: I used semantic HTML elements to organize the content logically. Each section, like the navigation bar, intro, and footer, has a dedicated structure to enhance readability and SEO.

CSS Styling: Custom CSS was applied for layout and design consistency, focusing on font styles, spacing, and visual hierarchy to ensure clarity and user engagement.

Navigation and Linking: Navigation links and anchor elements were implemented to provide smooth transitions between pages and enhance the user experience.

Responsive Design: I included the viewport meta tag to ensure a responsive layout across different screen sizes. This is crucial in providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.


## 2. New Skills/ Knowledge Acquired;

Through this project, I gained experience in the following areas:

Design Principles in Web Development: I learned how to incorporate basic design principles such as balance, alignment, and contrast. This helped me ensure that the page looks visually appealing and professional.

Using Icons and Images Effectively: I practiced embedding and positioning social media icons and images within sections, learning to work with file formats like .webp for optimized performance.

File Linking and Organization: Managing multiple files (HTML, CSS, images) for a web project taught me more about the importance of organized directories and relative paths, especially for web-based file linking.


## 3. What I Learned;

Throughout this project, I learned the importance of structuring HTML to enhance both functionality and user experience. Specific takeaways include:

The Role of CSS for Visual Consistency: Styling is essential not only for visual appeal but also for usability, and small CSS changes (like spacing, font size, or text alignment) can make a huge difference.

User-Centric Design: Including navigation elements like "Download CV" or "About Me" links was an eye-opener in thinking about user needs and how people interact with a portfolio site.

Code Readability and Maintainability: Organizing HTML elements logically, moving inline styles to CSS, and labeling sections in code make it easier for me (and others) to understand and update the code in the future.


## 4. Challenges and Solutions;

- Challenge: Maintaining Consistent Layouts
Ensuring that each section had a consistent layout and spacing was challenging, especially as new elements were added.
- Solution: I addressed this by using CSS classes to manage styling across similar elements, which not only saved time but also kept styling uniform and manageable.

- Challenge: Image and Icon Positioning
Positioning images and icons effectively, particularly in the social media section, was initially difficult as they needed to look aligned and balanced.
- Solution: I experimented with CSS properties like flexbox to arrange icons neatly and centered. Using padding and margin adjustments helped me fine-tune their placement.

- Challenge: Linking to External Resources
Managing relative links to CSS, images, and other HTML pages could easily break if files weren’t organized correctly.
- Solution: I created a structured folder system for the project, with dedicated directories for images and stylesheets, and tested all links to ensure they worked properly.

## Conclusion
This project not only helped me refine my skills in HTML and CSS but also taught me a great deal about organizing a webpage for visual impact and user experience. I’ve gained valuable insights into responsive design, navigation, and structuring a personal portfolio site that is both functional and engaging.
